Algorithm Credit: The numeric encoding algorithm implemented in this gem is
based on the work in YottaDB/GT.M, originally developed by Greystone Technology
Corporation in the 1980s and currently maintained by YottaDB LLC under AGPLv3.
This Ruby implementation is a clean-room reimplementation of the algorithm.
